## Introduction
TBD. <br>

## Overview
Businesses and organizations must understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions. <br>
For example, a company may want to predict a car's fuel efficiency based on weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. <br>
Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making. <br>

## Dataset

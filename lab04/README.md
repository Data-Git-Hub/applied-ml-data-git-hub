# Lab04

## Introduction
The objective of the TODO  <br>

## Overview
Businesses and organizations must understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions. <br>
For example, a company may want to predict a car's fuel efficiency based on weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. <br>
Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making. <br>

This project demonstrates your ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will: <br>
- We use three common classification models in this lab. <br>

- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)

A Decision Tree splits data into smaller groups based on decision rules (like "is height greater than 150 cm?"). Itâ€™s like a flowchart, where each decision point leads to another question until a final classification is reached. <br>

Strengths: Easy to interpret and fast to train. <br>
Weaknesses: Can overfit if the tree becomes too complex. <br>

- Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

A Support Vector Machine tries to find the "best boundary" (a hyperplane) that separates data into classes. It works well with complex data and small datasets. <br>

Strengths: Effective when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. <br>
Weaknesses: Computationally expensive for large datasets. <br>

- Neural Network (NN)

A Neural Network is inspired by how human brains process information. It consists of layers of interconnected "neurons" that process input data and adjust based on feedback. <br>

Strengths: Can handle complex patterns and non-linear relationships.<br>
Weaknesses: More data and tuning are needed to avoid overfitting.<br>
When trying to classify data, using three (or more) models can help:<br>

Decision Trees illustrate how individual features contribute to classification.<br>
SVMs are good at finding complex boundaries.<br>
Neural Networks are good at learning patterns from complex data. <br>

## Dataset 
TBD. TODO <br>.

## README.md (Required)

Include a professional README.md. Include:
- a personalized title
- an introduction to your project
- a clickable link to your notebook file.
- Instructions on how to set up your virtual environment and run your notebook locally.
   
If starting with an assignment README, remove the parts you do not need to present your project.

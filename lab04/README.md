# Lab04

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a regression model that predicts medical insurance charges based on the demographic and health-related attributes provided in the dataset. The goal is to investigate how features such as age, BMI, and smoking status impact medical costs and to compare the performance of various regression techniques, including linear regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and polynomial regression.  <br>

## Overview
Businesses and organizations must understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions. <br>
For example, a company may want to predict a car's fuel efficiency based on weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. <br>
Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making. <br>

## Dataset 
I am using the Medical Cost Personal Dataset, which contains information about individual medical insurance charges. Each record in the dataset includes a person's age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and residential region, along with the insurance charges they incurred. <br>

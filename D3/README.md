## Introduction
In this project, we will construct a Binary Confusion Matrix to evaluate the performance of a classification model using the weatherAUS.csv dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains weather-related variables collected in Australia. For this analysis, we will focus solely on the last two columns of the dataset, which represent the actual and predicted classifications of a binary eventâ€”whether or not it rained the next day and limiting our sample size to only 1000 records.. <br>

## Overview
Businesses and organizations often need to understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions.
For example, a company may want to predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on its weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location.
Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making. <br>

This project demonstrates your ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:
- Extracting the relevant data columns from the dataset. <br>
- Constructing a Binary Confusion Matrix based on the actual and predicted values. <br>
- Analyzing model performance using standard evaluation metrics derived from the confusion matrix. <br>

## Professional Python Setup and Workflow
We follow professional Python practices. 
Full instructions are available at <https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/>. 
A concise version is provided at [WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](./docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

**Important:** VS Code + Pylance may fail to recognize installed packages in Jupyter notebooks.  
See the above guides for troubleshooting and solutions.

## Project Outline
Machine learning projects follow a structured approach.
We will use this approach throughout the course. 

1) Load and Explore the Data (Base Model)
2) Data Preprocessing (Base Model)
3) Constructing the Binary Confusion Matrix (Base Model)
4) Model Evaluation Metrics
-  Base Model Evaluation
-  Raise the Bar Model
-  Lower the Bar Model
5) Conclusion and Next Steps (Base Model, Raise the Bar Model, Lower the Bar Model

Start your notebook professionally with:
- a single top-level title
- your name (or alias)
- the date
- a brief introduction that describes the problem and the dataset.
- Import the external Python libraries used (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.)

Present your work in clearly numbered second-level and third-level headings

### Section 1: Load and Explore the Data (Base Model)

### Section 2: Data Preprocessing (Base Model)

### Section 3: Constructing the Binary Confusion Matrix (Base Model)

### Section 4: Model Evaluation Metrics

### Section 5: Conclusion and Next Steps (Base Model, Raise the Bar Model, Lower the Bar Model)

## README.md (Required)

Include a professional README.md. Include:
- a personalized title
- an introduction to your project
- a clickable link to your notebook file.
- Instructions on how to set up your virtual environment and run your notebook locally.
   
If starting with an assignment README, remove the parts you do not need to present your project.

    "### Introduction\n",
    "The objective of the Wine dataset classification problem is to predict the origin of wines based on their chemical characteristics. By analyzing 13 different features, such as alcohol content, malic acid, ash, alkalinity of ash, magnesium content, and several others, we aim to classify a given wine into one of three possible cultivars. This classification task helps in understanding the relationship between the chemical properties and the quality or type of wine, serving as a basis for further research in oenology and machine learning.\n",

    "- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Decision Tree splits data into smaller groups based on decision rules (like \"is height greater than 150 cm?\"). Itâ€™s like a flowchart, where each decision point leads to another question until a final classification is reached. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Easy to interpret and fast to train.<br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Can overfit if the tree becomes too complex. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Support Vector Machine tries to find the \"best boundary\" (a hyperplane) that separates data into classes. It works well with complex data and small datasets. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Effective when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. <br.>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Computationally expensive for large datasets. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Network (NN)\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Neural Network is inspired by how human brains process information. It consists of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that process input data and adjust based on feedback. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Can handle complex patterns and non-linear relationships. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Needs more data and tuning to avoid overfitting.<br>\n",

    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",

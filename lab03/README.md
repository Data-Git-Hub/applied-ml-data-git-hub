## Introduction
TBD. <br>

## Overview
Businesses and organizations must understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions.
For example, a company may want to predict a car's fuel efficiency based on its weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location.
Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making. <br>

This project demonstrates your ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:

## Professional Python Setup and Workflow
We follow professional Python practices. 
Full instructions are available at <https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/>. 
A concise version is provided at [WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](./docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

**Important:** VS Code + Pylance may fail to recognize installed packages in Jupyter notebooks.  
See the above guides for troubleshooting and solutions.

## Project Outline
Machine learning projects follow a structured approach.
We will use this approach throughout the course. 

1) Load and Explore the Data TBD.


Start your notebook professionally with:
- a single top-level title
- your name (or alias)
- the date
- a brief introduction that describes the problem and the dataset.
- Import the external Python libraries used (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.)

Present your work in clearly numbered second-level and third-level headings

### Section 1: Load and Explore the Data

## README.md (Required)

Include a professional README.md. Include:
- a personalized title
- an introduction to your project
- a clickable link to your notebook file.
- Instructions on how to set up your virtual environment and run your notebook locally.
   
If starting with an assignment README, remove the parts you do not need to present your project.
